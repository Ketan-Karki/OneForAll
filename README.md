This is a fully responsive live inventory site for both consumers and retailers.
Objective is to build a website from which consumers will be able to check the live inventories of the nearby stores. They can also check for the availability of specific products in their nearest stores.
On the other hand Retailers will regularly update their inventory through the web-app, this will cancel out their need of any excel sheet or other inventory manager. Also retailers will get an option to know about the on demand products in their locality, so that they can buy adequate stock of that product which will increase their sales.
In this web application, we will create a user-friendly environment where the consumers will be able to enter their location and search for the required product in their nearby stores. Retailers too will be able to update their inventory and view on demand products in their locality. We will use HTML,CSS, and JavaScript for the front end of the Website. For the option of signing in through google and facebook, we'll have their API. More and more features will be added with time.
